# Portal

The first articulating arm of ReneVerse’s interoperability technology is the ReneVerse Portal, a central hub dedicated to asset manipulation and management for both players and developers/studios. Within the Portal, there are a number of features that allow users to not only browse and select playable ReneVerse-connected borderless games but also manage, transfer, and transact the Digital Assets that exist within those games.

For players, the ReneVerse Portal acts as a home base for all things in the ecosystem. From the Portal, players can accomplish the following:

* View and play ReneVerse-connected, borderless games from a wide library of game developers and studios
* Upload and mint digital asset NFTs that have been either purchased or earned from any of the games within the ReneVerse catalog of borderless games
* Manage digital asset NFTs from multiple games that have been collected
* Transfer digital asset NFTs from one borderless game to another
* Export digital asset NFTs to third-party services, including marketplaces like OpenSea or other platforms like staking/lending&#x20;

For developers and studios, the ReneVerse Portal provides a more advanced set of features that facilitate consistent control over original digital asset IP, regardless of where it has been transferred.

* Upload and mint digital assets from your game as NFTs to be made usable across the entire catalog of borderless games.
* Customize and refine digital asset NFT parameters
* View digital asset NFTs from other borderless games
* Track digital asset NFTs once they have been transferred to users or out of the ReneVerse ecosystem
* And more to come…
