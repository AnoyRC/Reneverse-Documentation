# Platform

The ReneVerse platform is constructed of multiple layers to serve both players and developers, each of which have their own needs and objectives. For both parties, the toolkit is designed to return autonomy and control to the user with interfaces and tools that do not require any prior knowledge of web3 or blockchain tools, regardless of whether they are a player or developer.&#x20;

The entire ReneVerse platform is constructed around a core interoperability engine, which unlocks a suite of interoperability and blockchain-related features. Around this engine are a handful of other tools that serve as both the means by which users can leverage our asset interoperability technology and as “arms” that our technology can articulate in order to interact with other services, whether those are other games or third-party blockchain-native platforms.

For players, the ReneVerse stack enables users to manage and monetize their digital assets, particularly through two structures/modules.&#x20;

* The ReneVerse Portal – A management hub that enables players to browse ReneVerse-connected games, mint Digital Asset NFTs, and connect with external blockchain services including third-party marketplaces such as OpenSea.
* GameConnect – An intuitive player account system where users can access the ReneVerse and its blockchain features by registering with just their email.&#x20;

As for independent game developers and fully-fledged gaming studios, ReneVerse provides a more advanced set of features that enable detailed manipulation and customization of the developers’ gaming assets and facilitate streamlined integration with blockchains.

* The ReneVerse SDKs & API – The SDKs (Unity and Unreal) are the developer’s gateway to the ReneVerse and provides the developer with easy-to-implement code packages that will integrate asset interoperability and blockchain functionality into their game. Highly Scalable and Robust API architecture is used behind SDKs so that the onboarding process of games on-chain is fast and simple, and requires zero prior experience in building blockchain or web3-specific software.
* The ReneVerse Portal – The Developer View of the ReneVerse Portal gives developers control over not only which assets from their game they want to integrate with the blockchain but also manage asset specifications unique to each digital asset.

Multichain Support – Developers are able to choose their preferred blockchain network to integrate and store their one or many game assets. These assets, once integrated with the selected blockchain, are then accessible within the ReneVerse Portal. The Ethereum blockchain is the first blockchain that is connected to the ReneVerse, with others soon following, including BSC, Polygon, Solana, Optimism & Arbitrum.
