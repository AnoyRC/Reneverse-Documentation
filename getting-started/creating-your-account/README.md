# Creating your account

The ReneVerse enables players and game developers to tokenize their items and achievements and better benefit from the value of these digital assets. Our solution encourages economic activity by encouraging players and developers to profit from their digital assets while providing a more fabulous pool of usable assets that can port between games. Independent developers, in particular, can benefit from the portability and utility of NFT assets, as they can integrate their work into the games of big-budget studios and vice-versa.
