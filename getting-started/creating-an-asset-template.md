# Creating an Asset Template

### Creating a collection

A collection helps in keeping your asset templates organized. Your game may be asset-intensive and you can't handle or find a particular asset in Reneverse Portal. Here, A collection helps you to categorize assets by your likings and keeps your project organized.

Open your game and click on New Collection.

Click on the collection you made to view the asset templates you created earlier.

### Creating an Asset template

Asset templates define how your asset looks or constitutes. Like the NFTs sold under a specific blockchain have their name, description, and attributes, Reneverse Asset Template makes an asset ready to be minted with required credentials in the blockchain, you chose your game to be in.

Let's create our first asset template by clicking on New Asset Template.
