# Configuring Asset Template

Before we mint our first asset, we must configure our asset template with a name, description, images, and attributes. This insures that the user mints the exact asset that is being portrayed in the game and is not misleading by any means.

The asset template tab consists of three options:

* [game-engine-files.md](game-engine-files.md "mention")
* [metadata.md](metadata.md "mention")
* [assets.md](assets.md "mention")
