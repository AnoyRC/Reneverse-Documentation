# Adding your game

The games made by you won't be available in the Reneverse Portal. We have to add the game manually so that we can use Reneverse Portal to define and add assets.

Let's start creating our game by adding our game to Reneverse Dashboard by clicking on New Game.

Fill up the details and click on Create. I have added details for my game:

Wait for a few minutes and it will be added to your dashboard.
