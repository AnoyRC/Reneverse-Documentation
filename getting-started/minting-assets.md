# Minting Assets

### What is Minting?

In the context of web3 and blockchain technology, "minting" refers to the process of creating a new digital asset or token on a blockchain. It involves the generation and registration of a unique token that represents a specific item, asset, or piece of data.

When minting a token, a smart contract is written to define the characteristics and properties of the token. These properties can include the total supply, the name, the symbol, and any additional metadata associated with the token. The smart contract ensures that the token adheres to predefined rules and standards, such as the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

#### Asset Recipient

If you are minting your first asset, preferably select your username as asset recipient, or if you want to mint the asset for someone else, search the username of that individual and click to select him/her as asset recipient.

#### Asset Title & Description

Asset Title and Description should be set based on your previous values saved under [metadata.md](configuring-asset-template/metadata.md "mention"). Reneverse Portal also gives you the option to add a custom title and description in the mint dialog.

#### Asset Image & Animation

Asset image and animation should be selectable based on the images and animation uploaded in [metadata.md](configuring-asset-template/metadata.md "mention").

#### Asset Metadata Attribute Values

Asset Metadata Attribute Values should be added based on the attributes and values you added in [metadata.md](configuring-asset-template/metadata.md "mention").



Finally, Click on Mint and we have started the process of minting. It will take 4-5 minutes to mint. You will get a final confirmation once the minting is complete.
